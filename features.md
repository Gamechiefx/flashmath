## **Core Learning Engine**
### **Adaptive Progression System**
*   **Tier-Based Mastery**: Users advance through 4 distinct tiers (I-IV) for each operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division), moving from basic facts to complex variable equations.
*   **Intelligent Placement**: A speed-aware placement test analyzes not just accuracy but response time to instantly slot users into their optimal challenge zone.
*   **Fluency-First Metrics**: The system distinguishes between "knowing" (correct answer) and "mastering" (fast answer). Speed penalties ensure users only advance when they demonstrate true fluency (<5s response).

### **Focused Practice Mode**
*   **Smart Error Handling**: "Pause-and-Learn" mechanics stop the timer on incorrect answers, offering immediate explanations without stressful penalties.
*   **Missed Problem Tracking**: The system remembers specific equations where the user struggles ("Weakest Links") and surfaces them for targeted improvement.
*   **Keyboard-First Workflow**: Optimized for speed with full keyboard support (Space to skip, Enter to submit) for a "flow state" experience.

## **Gamification & Engagement**
### **Compelling Loop**
*   **Currency (Flux Coins)**: Users earn currency for every correct answer and completed session, creating a tangible reward loop.
*   **XP & Leveling**: A persistent "Pilot Level" grows with lifetime XP, providing a long-term status symbol.
*   **Dynamic Streaks**: Visual streak counters and audio feedback (sound engine) reinforce consistent performance.

### **Social Competition (Leagues)**
*   **Weekly Leaderboards**: Users are segmented into tiered Leagues (Neon, Cobalt, Plasma, Void, Apex).
*   **Promotion/Relegation**: Top performers advance to higher leagues, driving weekly retention and recurring usage.

## **Analytics & Insights**
### **Professional-Grade Dashboard**
*   **Real-Time Telemetry**: Immediate visualization of Accuracy %, Average Speed (ms), and Rank.
*   **Mastery Heatmaps**: Detailed breakdown of progress toward the next Tier for every operation.
*   **Training History**: Complete log of recent sessions with XP earned and performance trends.

### **Deep-Dive Statistics**
*   **Career Overview**: Lifetime stats tracking total problems solved and long-term accuracy trends.
*   **Trend Analysis**: Visual graphs showing performance improvement over the last 10 sessions.
*   **Weakest Link Identification**: Automatic detection of the specific operation dragging down the user's average.

## **User Experience & Technology**
### **Premium "Neon" Aesthetic**
*   **Glassmorphism Console**: A modern, dark-mode interface with translucent glass elements and vibrant neon accents that feels like a professional tool, not a toy.
*   **Reactive UI**: Smooth animations (Framer Motion) and responsive layouts ensure the app feels alive and tactile.

### **Privacy & Control**
*   **Full Data Sovereignty**: Users have complete control to export stats or permanently delete their account and data instantly.
*   **Secure Authentication**: Enterprise-grade password hashing (Bcrypt) and session management.
